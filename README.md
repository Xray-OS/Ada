## Xray_OS 
Xray_OS is back, after being deprecated for a couple months, is now available again, this is not a mainstream distro or is not something made to compete with major distros, but what this actually is, it's just my personal archlinux distro that I created for my self, and may be in the future, this could be a nice project.

Now the ISO folder is in a process of being restore, and it's currently happening on Gitlab, so if you wanna checkout the buildfolder, then go to Gitlab, if is not there yet, then it will be soon, currently there isn't to much to say about the project, it's just been revived after a couple months, but.. as time progress things could get interesting.
