This is the iso build folder for Xray_OS. Big thanks to [Arcolinux](https://github.com/arcolinux), because it was my main learning source, to understand the way Arch Linux works in a manner that allows me to make this project possible, specifically, the ALCI Project: [Arch Linux Calamares Installer](https://github.com/arch-linux-calamares-installer).

# GO TO GITLAB FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE:
Dear user, due to the nature of GitHub, being absolutely restrictive, controlling and imposing unfair traits to their users repositories, if you really want to see all **Xray_OS-Repos**, then please go to my GitLab, all the vital repos for will be allowed there in better conditions for me. You can go there [Xray_OS-GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Xray_OS) 

# !IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD!: 

Careful, be aware that this distro is something that I created for my personal use, it may not work as expected for everyone.

## What is Xray_OS? 
Is Xray_OS the best Linux Distro for gaming? No, in that case use something like CachyOS or Nobara.

Xray_OS is just another, may be pointless for some, Arch Linux Distro, but its main focused it's towards the gaming side. The difference between Arch Linux Vanilla and Xray_OS, is that Xray_OS is Arch Linux but without the hassle of having to configure everything to make it suitable for normal activities or gaming.

Xray_OS has switchable graphics cards, it can work on Hybrid mode (default) or Integraded mode.

Xray_OS already comes with pre-installed software for gaming like Wine and all its dependencies, Unreal Engine dependencies, The normal software that everyone uses like, a music player, a video player, support for 32 bits, Flatpack etc.

NOTE: there is a version available that supports snapd.
