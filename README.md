# Ada
Formerly Xray_OS This is my own personal and customized Arch-based Linux instance nobody asked for, this ISO contains all of my personal settings and packages, that I normally use by default in Linux.

Currently is a project just for my personal use, I share it with the public, just in case someone wants to test it for fun.

## NVIDIA-DRIVERS or AMD-DRIVERS
In case of AMD, Linux already has native excellent support with AMD cards. When it comes to NVIDIA-drivers the support is excellent, mostly all essential processes NVIDIA-drivers requires are well supported.

## General Essential Tweaks to improve the experience in Linux
Little tweaks like support for things like switcheroo-control, supergfxctl, fstrim.timer (better performance for NVME or SSD drives), Bluetooth, Flatpak, KDE-Plasma preconfigured nicely, CHAOTIC-AUR integraded already, all necessary programs, custom-repos that included packages that are normally available in the AUR only, improvementss to the shell and several terminals settings.

## Conclusion
Like I said at the beginning, this is my personal Arch-based Linux OS instance, that I created for me mostly, to have my settings, my preferences, my style of how I like to set a Linux distro, for sure this can get better than what it currently is if people like it and would like to see it being supported, other than that.. is just a matter of time till it dies.
