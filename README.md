This is the iso build folder for Xray_OS. Big thanks to [Arcolinux](https://github.com/arcolinux), because it was my main learning source, to understand the way Arch Linux works in a manner that allows me to make this project possible, specifically, the ALCI Project: [Arch Linux Calamares Installer](https://github.com/arch-linux-calamares-installer).

### Don't care about reading, just want to download the ISO right now?

Here you go.. 

# !IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD!: 

Careful, be aware that this distro is something that I created for my personal use, it may not work as expected for everyone. At the moment it only works with PCs or Laptos that has NVIDIA GPUs. Support for AMD or no graphics cards at all will come in the future for sure.

## What is Xray_OS? 
Xray_OS overall it's a great Linux Distribution for gaming, that I've created, for my personal use, I always wanted to create my own OS, but since that's kind of impossible, well... why not making my own Linux Distro? From my favorite type which is Arch. Arch Linux it's just so flexible and customizable, and like everyone who ever heard of, or use Arch would say: we always have the latest and greatest software.

**My inspiration for creating Xray_OS, was given as an idea from distros like:** 

> **Nobara(mainly)** 

> **Pop!_OS** 

> **DTOS** 

> **XeroLinux.**

![Xray_OS](https://github.com/Xray-OS/xray_os/assets/143856402/6838b3ff-f63c-4e9f-9f9b-4c794eb65593)

But I really wanted to make it simple and not too complicated, so the plasma settings that Xray_OS uses are not so complex in terms of Beauty or Eye Candy. 

Xray_OS already comes with pre-installed software for gaming + Wine + Wine dependencies, dependencies for those who are interested to work with Unreal Engine, The normal software that everyone uses like, a music player, a video player, drivers for NVIDIA, libreoffice(fresh), support for 32 bits, an applicaion for downloading torrents, at least two browsers, AUR helpers, flatpack support, snapd support etc.., etc.

At the moment, this Linux distro is in a **BETA** state, so maybe a couple things would need some manual adjustment as you may notice. 

### Eg. 
* ~~Favorite apps are not shown in the Launcher.~~(FIXED)
* ~~A manual adjustment is require to show the preferred login manager chosen for the distro out of the box.~~(FIXED) 

Most of this issues will get fix eventually, remember this is still on **BETA**, so you're advised.

### ATTENTION: 
At the moment Xray_OS build folder has been taken off, due to procedures that needs to be applied to it, we hope that eventually it's back on the repo.
