## Xray_OS(DEPRECATED) 
Xray_OS used to be an ArchLinux gaming distro, created in the middle of 2023, but due to negative reception, this project has been canceled.
Fortunately there's a new project similar to what this used to be, that i created my self too, that project is [XeroArch](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xeroarch/)

## Besides the fact that this project has been canceled, I have to Thank all the people that try it and gave at least 2 stars, Thank You <3, i'll see you on:
[XeroArch](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xeroarch/)

# Some pictures on how this distro used to look.
