This is the iso build folder for Xray_OS. Big thanks to [Arcolinux](https://github.com/arcolinux), because it was my main learning source, to understand the way Arch Linux works in a manner that allows me to make this project possible, specifically, the ALCI Project: [Arch Linux Calamares Installer](https://github.com/arch-linux-calamares-installer).

## What is Xray_OS? 
I just want to clarify one thing, this is not a game changer, this is not really made for the public, this is only for my personal use, if you're really an experienced Linux user looking for the perfect this distro, this is not the place for you to be looking at.

The distro focuses mostly on having launchers for play video games and other improvements that i've made for myslef, but again, this is for personal use, stop criticizing this project like it is supposed to change the entire world, this is just my personal distro that i use just to not have to reinstall everything from the terminal.

# !IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD!: 

Careful, be aware that this distro is something that I created for my personal use, it may not work as expected for everyone.
